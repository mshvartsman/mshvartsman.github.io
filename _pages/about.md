I am a research scientist at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://research.fb.com/category/augmented-reality-virtual-reality/), working at the intersection of computational cognitive science and machine learning to make the future of augmented/virtual reality awesome. I did my postdoc with [Jon Cohen](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/jonathan-cohen) at the the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu), and my Ph.D at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu) with [Rick Lewis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rickl/ricklewis.html) and [Satinder Singh](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/). I got into science working as an RA for [Colin Phillips](http://ling.umd.edu/~colin/) at the University of Maryland [Cognitive Neuroscience of Language Lab](https://www.colinphillips.net/language-science/cnl-lab/), and writing my undergrad linguistics thesis with [Maria Pi√±ango](http://ling.yale.edu/people/maria-pi-ango) at [Yale](https://www.yale.edu), in between which I had a brief stint managing a multimillion-dollar emerging-markets product for [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com). 

My primary scientific interest is in building a computationally precise theory of human behavior, and testing it by using it to infer and predict cognitive processes jointly from behavioral and neural data. I think that smashing our best theories head-first into challenging naturalistic datasets is a useful complement to theory-driven experiments in the lab. 

My theoretical toolkit is focused on sequential sampling/random walk models, Bayesian statistics, and computational linguistics. My methodological toolkit is built around high performance computing for simulation and hierarchical probabilistic models for inference. I have end-to-end experimental expertise in eye-tracking and behavioral work (in the lab and online), and analysis (including methods development) for neuroimaging.
