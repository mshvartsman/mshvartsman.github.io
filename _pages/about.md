I am a research scientist at the [fundamental AI research (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/research/) lab at Meta, where I lead the human data program for the AI Research Agents project. Previously at FAIR, I led a workstream focused on foundation models for surface electromyography (EMG) and before that, I was at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://research.fb.com/category/augmented-reality-virtual-reality/), where I created and led the team behind [AEPsych](https://aepsych.org/), a platform for adaptive experimentation for human perception and perceptually-informed outcomes. I did my postdoc with [Jon Cohen](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/jonathan-cohen) at the the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu), and my Ph.D at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu) with [Rick Lewis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rickl/ricklewis.html) and [Satinder Singh](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/). I got into science working as an RA for [Colin Phillips](http://ling.umd.edu/~colin/) at the University of Maryland [Cognitive Neuroscience of Language Lab](https://www.colinphillips.net/language-science/cnl-lab/), and writing my undergrad linguistics thesis with [Maria Piñango](http://ling.yale.edu/people/maria-pi-ango) at [Yale](https://www.yale.edu), in between which I had a brief stint managing a multimillion-dollar emerging-markets product for [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com). 

I like to take applied problems and work on generalized ways to solve them that translate beyond a single use (whether as IC, TL, or manager). I enjoy building interdisciplinary bridges that translate ambiguous domain expert intuition into contemporary AI approaches, and creating artifacts like open-source platforms or foundation models that endure beyond a single project. 

I like to engage with the broader scientific community when I can, including as a founding organizer of [DeepMath](http://deepmath-conference.com/). I am open to volunteering my skills to good causes, talking to nontraditional candidates navigating the academia-industry transition, or serving on committees. LinkedIn is the best place to reach me for all of these. 

<!-- I turn theory into computational models and tools that make scientists more effective. Sometimes those scientists are just me, but I try to multiply my impact by helping people do better science. I'm passionate about understanding how humans make sense of the world and have done work on eye movement control, language and music processing, decision making, neuroimaging, and most recently psychophysics. While having a lot of data is great, I often gravitate to problems where we can bring domain knowledge and structure to data-poor problems. -->

<!-- My modeling toolkit is focused on dynamical system and probabilistic models (especially hierarchical models and Bayesian nonparametrics), though I have also published on neural network models and organize a [deep learning conference](http://deepmath-conference.com/). While I primarily do theoretical / modeling work now, I also have end-to-end expertise in methods for studying human brain and behavior (choice and response time data, eyetracking, and MEG/EEG), from experiment design to analysis.  -->
