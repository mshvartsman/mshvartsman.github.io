I am a research scientist the [fundamental AI research (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/research/) lab at Meta, where I lead a workstream focused on foundation models for surface electromyography (EMG). Previously, I was at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://research.fb.com/category/augmented-reality-virtual-reality/), where I created and led the team behind [AEPsych](https://aepsych.org/), a platform for adaptive experimentation for human perception and perceptually-informed outcomes. I did my postdoc with [Jon Cohen](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/jonathan-cohen) at the the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu), and my Ph.D at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu) with [Rick Lewis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rickl/ricklewis.html) and [Satinder Singh](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/). I got into science working as an RA for [Colin Phillips](http://ling.umd.edu/~colin/) at the University of Maryland [Cognitive Neuroscience of Language Lab](https://www.colinphillips.net/language-science/cnl-lab/), and writing my undergrad linguistics thesis with [Maria Piñango](http://ling.yale.edu/people/maria-pi-ango) at [Yale](https://www.yale.edu), in between which I had a brief stint managing a multimillion-dollar emerging-markets product for [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com). 

I turn theory into computational models and tools that make scientists more effective. Sometimes those scientists are just me, but I try to multiply my impact by helping people do better science. I'm passionate about understanding how humans make sense of the world and have done work on eye movement control, language and music processing, decision making, neuroimaging, and most recently psychophysics. While having a lot of data is great, I often gravitate to problems where we can bring domain knowledge and structure to data-poor problems.

My modeling toolkit is focused on dynamical system and probabilistic models (especially hierarchical models and Bayesian nonparametrics), though I have also published on neural network models and organize a [deep learning conference](http://deepmath-conference.com/). While I primarily do theoretical / modeling work now, I also have end-to-end expertise in methods for studying human brain and behavior (choice and response time data, eyetracking, and MEG/EEG), from experiment design to analysis.
