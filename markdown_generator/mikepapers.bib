abstract = {The dynamics of simple decisions are well understood and modeled as a class of random walk models [e.g. 1-4]. However, most real-life decisions include a dynamically-changing influence of additional information we call context. In this work, we describe a computational theory of decision making under dynamically shifting context. We show how the model generalizes the dominant existing model of fixed-context decision making [2] and can be built up from a weighted combination of fixed-context decisions evolving simultaneously. We also show how the model generalizes recent work on the control of attention in the Flanker task [5]. Finally, we show how the model recovers qualitative data patterns in another task of longstanding psychological interest, the AX Continuous Performance Test [6] , using the same model parameters.},

The first portion of the thesis provides experimental ev- idence of adaptation of fixation durations to quantitatively-expressed payoffs in a simple reading task, and adaptation in the model on the same dimen- sion. The second portion explores spillover lexical frequency effects in the same framework and how they may emerge from a model that can adaptively allocate processing resources to foveal, parafoveal, and memory information. In addition to implications for eye movement control in reading, these find- ings can be interpreted to bear on task adaptation in reading, as well as the adaptive use of perception and memory in a sequential sampling framework.},

abstract = {Eye-movements in reading exhibit frequency spillover effects: fixation durations on a word are affected by the frequency of the previous word. We explore the idea that this effect may be an emer- gent property of a computationally rational eye- movement strategy that is navigating a tradeoff be- tween processing immediate perceptual input, and continued processing of past input based on mem- ory. We present an adaptive eye-movement con- trol model with a minimal capacity for such pro- cessing, based on a composition of thresholded se- quential samplers that integrate information from noisy perception and noisy memory. The model is applied to the List Lexical Decision Task and shown to yield frequency spilloverâ€”a robust prop- erty of human eye-movements in this task, even with parafoveal masking. We show that spillover in the model emerges in approximately optimal con- trol policies that sometimes process memory rather than perception. We compare this model with one that is able to give priority to perception over mem- ory, and show that the perception-priority policies in such a model do not perform as well in a range of plausible noise settings. We explain how the frequency spillover arises from a counter-intuitive but fundamental property of sequenced thresholded samplers. 1},

@article{Bergelson2013,
abstract = {We investigated the electrophysiological response to matched two-formant vowels and two-note musical intervals, with the goal of examining whether music is processed differently from language in early cortical responses. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we compared the mismatch-response (MMN/MMF, an early, pre-attentive difference-detector occurring approximately 200 ms post-onset) to musical intervals and vowels composed of matched frequencies. Participants heard blocks of two stimuli in a passive oddball paradigm in one of three conditions: sine waves, piano tones and vowels. In each condition, participants heard two-formant vowels or musical intervals whose frequencies were 11, 12, or 24 semitones apart. In music, 12 semitones and 24 semitones are perceived as highly similar intervals (one and two octaves, respectively), while in speech 12 semitones and 11 semitones formant separations are perceived as highly similar (both variants of the vowel in 'cut'). Our results indicate that the MMN response mirrors the perceptual one: larger MMNs were elicited for the 12-11 pairing in the music conditions than in the language condition; conversely, larger MMNs were elicited to the 12-24 pairing in the language condition that in the music conditions, suggesting that within 250 ms of hearing complex auditory stimuli, the neural computation of similarity, just as the behavioral one, differs significantly depending on whether the context is music or speech.},

@inproceedings{Shvartsman2017,
abstract = {The dynamics of human and animal behavior within a perceptual decision made based on a single stationary stimulus are consistent with sequential statistical testing (e.g. Bogacz et al. 2006) instantiated as the discrete-time sequential prob- ability ratio test (SPRT; Wald {\&} Wolfowitz, 1948) or its continuous time analogue, the diffusion model (DDM; Ratcliff, 1978). In this simple domain, the SPRT/DDM with a fixed threshold is both reward-rate- and Bayes-optimal. However, in nonstationary or multihypothesis settings, these criteria need not be equivalent: fixed threshold policies are not optimal under either criterion, and there is no systematic framework to compute reward-rate-optimal policies (though cf. Mahadevan, 1996; Dayanik{\&}Yu, 2013). Consequently, work on the dynamics of decisions over nonstationary stimuli or multiple choices has either explored Bayes-optimal policies by dynamic programming (e.g. Frazier{\&}Yu, 2008; Drugowitsch et al. 2012) or used fixed threshold policies (e.g. McMillen {\&} Holmes 2006, Norris 2009). We use our model of the dynamics of multi-stimulus decision making to explore the differences between fixed-threshold and Bayes-optimal policies in different tasks, exploiting the connections between Markov decision processes, Bayesian inference, and diffusion (e.g. Dayan {\&} Daw, 2008) to do so. We show that even in simple tasks, predictions can depend on whether we assume the organism uses the fixed-threshold policy or the Bayes-optimal policy. Specifically, we show that different explanations for the flanker effect (Yu, et al. 2009; White et al. 2011) are normative under different choices of the action set and policy space. We additionally show that the Bayes-optimal policy makes the unusual prediction that as the posterior probability of some hypotheses drops due to evidence, the decision criterion for the remaining hypotheses should rise. We speculate that the intention superiority effect in prospective memory could be evidence of such a rise.},

abstract = {What mechanisms support our ability to estimate durations on the order of minutes? Behavioral studies in humans have shown that changes in contextual features lead to overestimation of past durations. Based on evidence that the medial temporal lobes and prefrontal cortex represent contextual features, we related the degree of fMRI pattern change in these regions with people's subsequent duration estimates. After listening to a radio story in the scanner, participants were asked how much time had elapsed between pairs of clips from the story. Our ROI analyses found that duration estimates were correlated with the neural pattern distance between two clips at encoding in the right entorhinal cortex. Moreover, whole-brain searchlight analyses revealed a cluster spanning the right anterior temporal lobe. Our findings provide convergent support for the hypothesis that retrospective time judgments are driven by 'drift' in contextual representations supported by these regions.},
